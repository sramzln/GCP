## Image families

Public image families
Compute Engine provides image families to help you ensure that your automation systems can reference the latest images. As an administrator, you can group a set of images as an image family. Then users of the images only have to keep track of the image-family name, rather than an exact image name. Because image names must be unique, image-build pipelines often create image names with information encoded in them, such as the application name, date, and version, for example, my-application-v3-20210101. In automation tools, you can reference the image family name instead of having to update the image name at intervals. Using image families ensures that you always access the latest image in the family, for example, my-application.

Custom image families
You can create custom image families for your custom images. The image family points to the most recent image that you used to create the image family. To roll an image family back to a previous image version, you can deprecate the most recent image in that family (as long as the previous image is not deprecated).
